# Car Fit-Bit
## A fitbit for your car!

### Taking proper and timely care of car is a universal necessity and often a frustrating task and people often forget important steps which usually they should take if not followed would result in breakdown at unceremonial times. 
	
### Through this project, I am building an app that will assist an user by showing them real time information about important parameters of their car at their fingertips. It will also assist users in finding and paying for parking, finding gas stations along with other user friendly features.

(Note: The project serves as a skeleton application for a car health monitoring project)
